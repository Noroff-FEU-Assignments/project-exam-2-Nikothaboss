## Goal

To take the skills learned over the last two years and take on an extensive project where the finished product should reflect the candidate's general development capabilities, in addition to visual and technical skills.

## Description

In this project I created a booking site for Bergen Booking with a customer part and a admin part.

The customer side is where users can find and book hotels. Also be able to send messages to the admin side

Admin side where you can log in to see bookings and messages sent from the customer side. Here you will also be able to edit, create and delete hotels.
